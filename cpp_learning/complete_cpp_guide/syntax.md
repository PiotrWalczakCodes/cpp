## Syntax
- Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of a language. Syntax in computer programming means the rules that control the structure of the symbols, punctuation, and words of a programming language.

- Without syntax, the meaning or semantics of a language is nearly impossible to understand.

- For example, a series of English words, such as — subject a need and does sentence a verb — has little meaning without syntax.

- Applying basic syntax results in the sentence — Does a sentence need a subject and verb?
