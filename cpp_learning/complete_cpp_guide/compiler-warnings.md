## Compiler warnings
- Compiler warnings appear when the compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem
- It's only a warning because the compiler is still able to generate correct machine code 
```
int number;
std::cout << number;
```
warning: number is uninitialized<br>
- **Treat warnings like errors. Don't ignore them!**
