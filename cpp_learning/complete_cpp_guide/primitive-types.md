## C++ primitive data types
### Character types
- Used to represent single characters
- Bigger types are used to represent more complicated character sets<br>

| title | size |
| --- | --- |
| char | Exactly one byte. At least 8 bits|
| char16_t | At least 16 bits | 
| char32_t | At least 32 bits | 
| wchar_t | Can represent the largest available character set |
### Integer types
- Used to represent whole numbers
- There are signed & unsigned versions

| title | size |
| --- | --- |
| short | At least 16 bits|
| int | At least 16 bits | 
| long | At least 32 bits | 
| long long | At least 64 bits |

| title | size |
| --- | --- |
| unsigned short | At least 16 bits|
| unsigned | At least 16 bits | 
| unsigned long | At least 32 bits | 
| unsigned long long | At least 64 bits |
### Floating point types
- Used to represent non-integer numbers

| tile | size |
| --- | --- |
| float | / 7 decimal digits |
| double | / 15 decimal digits |
| long double | / 19 decimal digits | 

### Boolean type
- Used to represent true and false
- Zero is false
- Non-zero is true 

| tile | size |
| --- | --- |
| fbool | usually 8 bits |
