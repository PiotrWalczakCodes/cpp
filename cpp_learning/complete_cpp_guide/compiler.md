## Compiler

- A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++. A programmer writes the source code in a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes an editor, saving the source code to one or more text files. A compiler that supports the source programming language reads the files, analyzes the code, and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform.
