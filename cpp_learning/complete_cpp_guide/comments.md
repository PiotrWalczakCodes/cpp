## Comments
- Comments are programmer readable explanations in the source code
- Preprocessor strips out comments & replaces them with a single space.

- Types of comments:
  - Single line comments:
    - `// comment here`  
  - Multi-line comments:
    - ```
      /*
      multi
      line 
      comment
      */
- Don't comment obvious things!
